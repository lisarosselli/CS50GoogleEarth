# CS50GoogleEarth

Cataloguing what was an old problem set from CS50 here.
Could use some cleanup and potentially some more fleshing out.

The jist of this project: CS50 TAs are randomly dropped around the Harvard Campus. We created a "shuttle bus" of sorts to maneuver around campus to pick them up and drop them off at their respective houses.

**Should be run from a local server in order to properly see TA images on the map.**
